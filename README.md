# Unity-maze-explorer-ML-Agent
Project that was used in my master's thesis


This project's purpose is to explore how unoptimized curriculum learning affects the learning of a maze exploring ML agent.

There are two different agents in this project: one that uses Raycast Perception Sensor 3D as its sensor and the other uses normalized bitmask as a way to gather observations.

You can change the size of the maze, wheter or not the maze's goal is placed randomly and how many goals are there in a maze.
